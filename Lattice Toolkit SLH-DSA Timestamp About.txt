Overview
SLH-DSA Timestamp is a serverless, offline tool that creates quantum-resistant, stateless digital timestamps using SLH-DSA (SPHINCS+ with SHAKE-256), standardized in FIPS 205 (August 2024). It proves that a file — document, image, dataset, or record — existed at a specific moment in time and has not been altered since — even centuries later, even under quantum attack.

How It Works
Input
Drag any file into the application
Hashing
File + UTC nanosecond timestamp → SHAKE-256 digest
Key Generation
SLH-DSA keypair (stateless)
Public Key: 64 bytes
Private Key: 128 bytes (ephemeral or persistent)
Signing
WOTS+ one-time chains + XMSS-like Merkle tree
SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256 produces:
Signature: ~16,640 bytes
Merkle path + WOTS+ chain state
Output
.timestamp file contains:
SLH-DSA signature
Public key
Original file hash
ISO 8601 timestamp with nanosecond precision
Verification
Any device, any time:
Recompute file + timestamp hash
Reconstruct Merkle path
Validate against public root
Match = proven existence & integrity

DISCLAIMER: made by Grok 3 on 10/26/25
This code? Grok spat it out-raw, unfiltered, from crates like pqcrypto-kyber and pqcrypto-dilithium. I just typed build the Notary and watched it bloom. No PhD, no lab coat, no fridge in the basement. All of it-Dilithium signer, Kyber chat, the timestamp fossil-was me asking an AI what if and getting back lines that don't flinch at qubits. I didn't invent lattices. I didn't break Shor. I just compiled what already survives him. If it works, credit NIST. If it crashes, blame me. And Grok? Grok's just the quiet one in the corner who never sleeps. No warranties. Use at your own risk. When the grid flickers, don't call me-call the math.
